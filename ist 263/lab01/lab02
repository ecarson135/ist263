<h1><strong>Elizabeth Carson's Bio</strong></h1>
<br>
<h2>Hi everyone, I’m Liz a senior at Syracuse University majoring in Policy Studies with a minor in Information Management & Technology with an interest in Public Health and Management. After graduation I am hoping to pursue a Masters Degree at Upstate Medical University here in Syracuse, New York. In what you may ask? I’ll let you know when I figure it out. Here at Syracuse University I’ve been able to develop a variety of helpful skills such as: </h2>
<ul>   
<li>Programming in Microsoft Excel</li>
   <li>Critical Thinking</li>
    <li>First Aid/CPR</li>
   <li> Positive Leadership and Team Building</li>
     <li></li>Adaptability Towards Various Situations</li> 
    </ul> 

   <meta charset="utf-8">Alongside the various helpful skills that I obtain, I’ve pursued an assortment of hobbies such as pottery and acrylic painting, which help me practice mindfulness during the school year. Different relaxing activities I partake in include: napping, meditating, and reading murder mystery books. During my downtime or while procrastinating assignments and when I am not rapidly scrolling through TikTok,  I keep up with new episodes of the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City and NJ, and I have recently started rewatching Family Guy.
